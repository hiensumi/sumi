# Extensions

This directory contains headers/sources that add additional features to 
the editor. Even if some feature in this folder does not work, 
the user can still use the editor to compile and test the programs.

**All code in this folder must be under namespace `Extensions` and its 
settings (if any) should be under `Extensions/$featurename`**
